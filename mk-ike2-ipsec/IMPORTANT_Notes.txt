1) IPSEC ikev2 provides pure L3 connectivity thus it can't be bridged to any L2 domain
2) IPSEC bridge can not be under VRF, the client can reach to other side of MPLS, :(, L3VPN with IPSEC sucks unless to have dedicated device for ipsec and edge for MPLS
3) mode-config responsible for pushing routes to client, client install default route to ipsec, but it is possible to disable it ("interface->network_option->ipv4->advanced....")
